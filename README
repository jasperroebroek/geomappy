This project was created to interface raster and shape files and facilitate plotting them in a homogeneous way. See the
examples notebook for visual examples of the interfacing and plotting functionality.

Beside this the project contains:
 - Both reading and writing files through the same Map interface, making it convenient to pull a file, do some
    calculations and store the result back in a file. This also works with the tiling behaviour displayed in the
    notebook. This helps in breaking up the calculations, needing much less memory to work with huge files.
 - focal statistics through the Map interface (geomappy.focal_statistics)
 - functions to extend the rasterio functionality, such as reprojecting a file based on the profile of another file
    (geomappy.utils)
 - several handy functions for color mixing (geomappy.colors)
 - a progress bar function (geomappy.utils)
 - ND rolling functions (geomappy.rolling)
